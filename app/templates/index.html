            <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a <b>Junior Engineer</b> looking for a exciting project that I can be apart of.<br>
                I try to focus on writing <b>clean, reusable code</b> that is <b>efficient</b> and <b>easy</b> to read.<br>
                I have experience designing and implementing applications in Python, Assembly as well as C++/#.<br>
                I like to think of clever solution to challenging problems and to contantly learn new things.
            </p>
            <p>
                Besides programming, I have interests in photography, fashion, interior design and skateboarding.<br>
                <!-- In a age of consumerism, I think it's important for people to create content and not just consume.<br>
                I also like to eat food and travel. My favorite place is Japan and I hope to one day live there.<br> -->

            <h1><a href="https://github.com/TonyTheTaiga/slackbot" target="_">Crypto Tracking Bot For Slack</a></h1>
            <p>
                A Slack bot server that adds commands to users in a chat room.<br>Incorporates a python script that
                fetches crpyto information
                from coinmarketcap’s API and returns it to users.<br>Implemented a modular design by separating the
                bot functions from the
                main functions.<br>Also improved runtime by storing the coin ID’s in a hashmap on startup.

            <h1><a href="https://github.com/TonyTheTaiga/Invaders" target="_">Embedded Space Invaders Clone</a></h1>
            <p>
                Space Invaders game written in assembly and flashed onto a LCP-2138 Arm Micro controller.<br>Made
                use
                of the GPIO
                and UART to receive/transmit data.<br>For example, the 7 segment display was used to show the
                score.<br>I
                Designed and
                implemented algorithms for every aspect of the game such as movement, attacking and as well as
                collision detection.

                properly use github
                from development to production and testing.
